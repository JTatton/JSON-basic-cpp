# JSON Easy C++


## Project Aim

The aim of this project is to make a simple class that can be used for retrieving data from a JSON file.

## Reason for Project

I just want a simple way to get information from a JSON file to use in other programs. I have attempted to use the numerous other C++ JSON programs/libraries which are all much more feature rich but I struggle to get to work nicely for what I want from them. This is in no way a replacement to those, especially for "power users", but more a challenge to myself to make something I can use in the future.
